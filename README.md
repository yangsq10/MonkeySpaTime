# MonkeySpaTime
## Background:
Snow monkeys like to soak in the hotspring. The snowmonkey park kindly provide the live camera to capture those monkey's funny moments. However, monkeys are not always around the camera, it's very likely that people go to check out the monkeys and find no monkeys there. 
The project used the YOLOv3 model to lively detect the images got from the live streaming camera and push notifications when there is a significant amount of monkeys. Check us at www.monkeyspatime.com !
