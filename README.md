# MonkeySpaTime
Background:
Snow monkeys like to soak in the hotspring. The snowmonkey park kindly provide the live camera to capture those monkey's funny moments. However, monkeys are not always around the camera, a lot of times they are in other places. The project used the computer vision YOLOv3 model to detect the images from the the monkey park camera and push notifications when there is a significant amount of monkeys.
